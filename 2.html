Get Started
===========


Inline Math
-----------

Inline math can be written in two ways. They can be enclosed
within <code>$</code> and <code>$</code>, or <code>\(</code> and
<code>\)</code>. For example, typing `$ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 $` or
`\( e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 \)` in the input pane produces the following output:
$e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$.



Displayed Math
--------------

Displayed math appears on its own line. To render displayed math, they
can be enclosed within <code>$$</code> and <code>$$</code>, or
<code>\[</code> and <code>\]</code>. For example, typing
<code>$$ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0. $$</code> or
<code>\[ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0. \]</code> in the code pane would produce the
following output: $$e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0.$$ Apart from this, many LaTeX
environments such as `equation`, `align`, etc. are also supported. The
list of supported environments can be found at [MathJax documentation on
supported environments][3]


Markdown Text
-------------

Mathematics and Markdown can be mixed freely while posting a math
snippet.


LaTeX Help
----------

This website uses [MathJax][1] to render math on the browser, so
the set of LaTeX commands that would work depends on the set of
LaTeX commands supported by MathJax. For a list of LaTeX
commands supported by MathJax, see [their documentation][2] on
LaTeX support. To learn how to use LaTeX, see
[Wikibooks: LaTeX/Mathematics][4].


Markdown Help
-------------

This website supports the [CommonMark][5] specification of Markdown. To
learn how to write text in Markdown, see the [CommonMark help page][6].
